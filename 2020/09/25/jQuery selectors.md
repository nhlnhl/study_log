# jQuery selectors
jQuery selectors are used to select which one of DOM objects would be used in a code.  
It is easier to use than original javaScript.  
(I'd like to use the word 'vanilla' in front of javaScript but 'Vanilla JS' already exists!)
1. ID
```
$('#ID');
```
2. class name
```
$('.class');
```
3. tag name
```
$('tag');
```
4. attribute
```
$('[attribute]');
```
Furthermore, there are much more variations in jQuery selector world... You can check those on the website below.
